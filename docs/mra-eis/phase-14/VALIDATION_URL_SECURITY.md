# VALIDATION URL SECURITY

`lib/mraEis/application/fiscalReceipt/validationUrlSecurity.js` — HTTPS, allowlist, no SSRF fetch.

---
*Phase 14 implementation. Fiscal receipts and validation QR codes are created only from conclusively accepted MRA response evidence + immutable fiscal snapshots. HTTP 200 alone is not acceptance. No synthetic production QR. Validation URLs are allowlisted. Original artifacts are immutable. Reprints preserve fiscal number/MRA txn/QR source. No Journal/Stock Movement. No MRA Sales resubmit. Production/live-sandbox receipt generation BLOCKED until QR/receipt contracts are verified.*

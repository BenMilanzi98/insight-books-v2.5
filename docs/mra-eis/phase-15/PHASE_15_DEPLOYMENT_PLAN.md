# PHASE 15 DEPLOYMENT PLAN

Apply Phase 15 migration; keep MRA_EIS_USE_MOCK=1; do not enable live Last Online/Offline.

---
*Phase 15 implementation. RECONCILE FIRST — DO NOT RETRY unknown outcomes. Timeout/HTTP 500/worker crash ≠ not processed. Absence from Last Online (single latest) is not conclusive. Safe retry reuses the same Transmission, Fiscal Snapshot and fiscal number; creates a new append-only Attempt only. No Journal/Stock Movement. No Snapshot/Response/Receipt mutation. No credentials/BAC. Live Last Online + Last Offline blocked until verified/certified. Production offline mode never auto-enabled.*
